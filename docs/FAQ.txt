    starting with the Minimal sample.

as well as generic classes provided by wxWidgets.


Can I use wxAutoExcel to manipulate Microsfot Excel files 
on a computer without Microsoft Excel installed?
---
No, wxAutoExcel uses OLE Automation which requires MS Excel
to be installed and working properly.

Which versions of Microsoft Excel are supported?
---
wxAutoExcel was developed along Microsoft Excel 2007. 
It supports a select few features of the 2010 version,
such as SparkLines. As of now, there is no support for
features introduced in version 2013 or newer.


Does wxAutoExcel supports all features Microsoft Excel exposes?

No, it does not come even close, see the class list in the HTML 
documentation for what is available. Even when a class is listed there,
some of its methods or properties may not be implemented.
Events are not supported at all.


I have multiple versions of Microst Excel installed - can 
I chose which version to use for automation?
---
Unfortunately, this is not possible, see e.g. here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/292491

Please be always as specific as possible when reporting an issue.
If it is build-related, make sure you followed the install instructions.
Provide all information required to successfully resolve the issue, 
including the error messages.
√èf your wxAutoExcel code does not work as expected, please:
(1) Make the shortest possible self-contained compilable example demonstrating 
    the issue, preferrably based on the most appropriate bundled sample.
(2)	Create and test the VBA equivalent of the code from (1) to make sure the issue 
    is within wxAutoExcel and not your code or Microsoft Excel itself.
(3) Post the issue on wxWidgets forums (https://forums.wxwidgets.org) 
    or report the issue on GitHub (https://github.com/pbfordev/wxAutoExcel/issues).
